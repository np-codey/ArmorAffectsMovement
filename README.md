# Armor Affects Movement

## Conflicts

Roleplay and Realism also has encumbrance (although it's total-weight based and only applies to walk/run), so having both enabled may apply to great a penalty. Disable the Encumbrance module in Roleplay and Realism, or disable the walk/run penalty setting in this mod as you prefer.

This mod overrides the CalculateClimbingChance formula, so any mods that also do the same may be incompatible. Please reach out if there's a clash of mods!

## Description

This mod causes a character's equipped weapon and armor to impact movement. Armor and weapon weight cause penalties to movement, jumping and climbing. In the case of movement, the character's strength will help mitigate some of this effect.

This is an RP-flavoured mod, essentially. The goal is to add a downside to wearing heavy armor, not only making it more realistic, but to give an actual advantage for wearing light armor. The vanilla Daggerfall experience makes it a no-brainer to go full daedric plate on any character since there is no apparent downside; armor is effectively a dodge suit. Thus, rogue/assassin/burglar characters will benefit from full freedom of movement with this, allowing them to freely climb and leap around, while heavier armoured characters will have to stick to the ground, or hasten themselves with magical means, thus allowing better for the idea of a magic-infused walking tank class.

To help with this, the baseline jump height has been increased so there are more acrobatic possibilities for light armor characters. Specifically, a character in leather armor with a daedric one-hander and a high jumping skill should be able to vault onto the roof of a small house with a running jump, as befitting a master escape artist like a burglar or assassin.

## Main features

* Walk and run speed is affected by the total weight of what you have equipped, mitigated by strength. There is an option to make this effect even stronger, or weaker. 
* Jump height is affected by the total weight of what you have equipped.
* Base jump height has been boosted, to give light armor users more acrobatic ability. There is an option to bring this back down to vanilla level.
* Climbing skill is affected by the total weight of what you have equipped; heavy armors making climbing extremely difficult even with high skill.
* Horse and cart travel should be the usual speed, to avoid travel tedium.
