# Armor Affects Movement

## Description

This mod applies the burden of armor and weapons on the player by restricting their movement. Characters with heavier equipment loadouts will receive penalties to movement, jumping and climbing. In the case of movement, the character's strength will help mitigate some of this effect.

This is an RP-flavoured mod, essentially. The goal is to add a downside to wearing heavy armor, not only making it more realistic, but to give an actual advantage for wearing light armor. The vanilla Daggerfall experience makes it a no-brainer to go full daedric plate on any character since there is no apparent downside; armor is effectively a dodge suit. Thus, rogue/assassin/burglar characters will benefit from full freedom of movement with this, allowing them to freely climb and leap around, while heavier armoured characters will have to stick to the ground, or hasten themselves with magical means, thus allowing better for the idea of a magic-infused walking tank class.

To help with this, the baseline jump height has been increased so there are more acrobatic possibilities for light armor characters. Specifically, a character in leather armor with a daedric one-hander and a high jumping skill should be able to vault onto the roof of a small house with a running jump.

Main features

* Walk and run speed is affected by the total weight of what you have equipped, mitigated by strength. There is an option to make this effect even stronger, or weaker. 
* Jump height is affected by the total weight of what you have equipped.
* Base jump height has been boosted, to give light armor users more acrobatic ability. There is an option to bring this back down to vanilla level.
* Horse and cart travel should be the usual speed, to avoid travel tedium.

## Installation

Go into the appropriate folder for your OS, and place the `.dfmod` file there into `StreamingAssets/Mods` folder in your DFU installation.

## TODO

- Horse jump height is increased due to the baseline jumping height boost (although it is reduced with armor also). We might want to reduce this specifically for horseback.
- Weight affects climbing (the player will slip more), with a "you slip!" message, perhaps.
- Running uses more endurance, as a function of weight.
- Feedback and messages: "Your armor weighs you down" and "Your armor makes climbing harder".
