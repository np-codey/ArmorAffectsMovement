# Armor Affects Movement

## Description

This mod applies the burden of armor and weapons on the player by restricting their movement speed. The heavier your equipment loadout, the slower you become. Characters with high strength can offset this to a certain extent.

This is an RP-flavoured mod, essentially. The goal is to put a downside on wearing heavy armor, to make it not only more realistic, but to give an actual advantage for wearing light armor. The vanilla Daggerfall experience makes it a no-brainer to go full daedric plate on any character since there is no apparent downside; armor is effectively a dodge suit. Thus, rogue/assassin/burglar characters will benefit from full freedom of movement with this, allowing them to freely climb and leap around, while heavier armoured characters will have to stick to the ground, or hasten themselves with magical means, thus allowing better for the idea of a magic-infused walking tank class.

Changes

* Walk and run speed is affected by the total weight of what you have equipped. There is an option to make this even stronger, or weaker. 
* Jump height is affect by the total weight of what you have equipped.
* Base jump height has been boosted, to give light armor users more acrobatic ability. A high run and jump character with light armor can vault onto a small house roof from the ground. There is an option to bring this back down to vanilla level.
* Horse and cart travel should be the usual speed, to avoid travel tedium.

## Installation

Go into the appropriate folder for your OS, and place the `.dfmod` file there into `StreamingAssets/Mods` folder in your DFU installation.

## TODO

- Restrict recalc code to only trigger on Inventory window, not every window
- Weight affects climbing (the player will slip more), with a "you slip!" message, perhaps
- Running uses more endurance as a function of weight
- Feedback and messages: "Your armor weighs you down" and "Your armor makes climbing harder"
